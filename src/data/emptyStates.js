/**
 * emptyStates.js — what a widget SAYS when it has nothing to draw.
 *
 * One table, two renderers: the real tile (`WidgetCard` → `WidgetEmpty`) and the
 * catalogue at /empty-states. A second copy of this wording is how the product and its
 * own reference page start out agreeing and stop three commits later.
 *
 * ── How the copy is written ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Two lines, and they have different jobs:
 *
 *   TITLE  names the absence in THIS chart's own terms. A funnel with no data has not
 *          "got no data", it has no stages; a gauge has nothing to measure; a pie has
 *          no shares to split. Naming the shape of the gap is what tells someone the
 *          widget is working and the period is simply quiet — the single most common
 *          misreading of an empty tile is "this is broken".
 *
 *   SUB    gives ONE next step, and only one the person can actually take from here.
 *          Two remedies exist and the split is deliberate:
 *            · time-shaped charts (line, gauge, funnel, histogram…) → widen the window,
 *              because their emptiness is nearly always the period being too short;
 *            · condition-shaped charts (bar, pie, heatmap, shortcut…) → widen the window
 *              OR ease a condition, because a filter that matches nothing is just as
 *              likely as a quiet week.
 *          Consistency here is a feature: one remedy learned once travels to every tile.
 *
 * No blame ("you have no data"), no jargon ("query returned 0 rows"), no apology for a
 * state that is usually correct. Nothing promises a fix the widget cannot perform.
 *
 * `art` is the ChartIcon name, which is NOT always the renderer's kind id: the product
 * calls the horizontal one Bar and the vertical one Column, the renderer calls them
 * 'hbar' and 'bar' (see data/chartTypes.js). Keeping the icon name in this table is what
 * stops that swap being re-derived — and re-derived wrongly — at the call site.
